# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-29)

**Core value:** A workshop attendee can clone the repo, run `docker compose up` + `mise run dev`, hit `POST /orders`, and see a single distributed trace flow from the HTTP handler through the RabbitMQ publish, into the consumer's processing logic, with correlated metrics and logs — and understand exactly which lines of SDK code made each piece work.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Baseline & Scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Baseline & Scaffold)
Plan: 6 of 6 in current phase (code complete; awaiting user tag)
Status: All 5 Phase 1 success criteria simultaneously green. Awaiting `git tag -a step-01-baseline` from user.
Last activity: 2026-04-29 — Plan 1-06 T1 (README + .gitignore) + T2 (5-criteria runtime verification) green. POST /orders → 202 + consumer-logged receipt UUID match; verify:bom zero OTel libs; preflight green; tree clean. T3 tag user-applied.

Progress: [█████████░] 95%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: SDK bootstrap (`OtelSdkConfiguration`) is **inlined per-service**, not extracted to a shared library — duplication is the lesson (TRACE-01, DOC-05).
- Initialization: AMQP propagation pair (`TracingMessagePostProcessor` + `TracingMessageListenerAdvice`) lives in a **shared** `otel-bootstrap` Maven module — symmetry of one inject method matched by one extract method IS the lesson (PROP-04).
- Initialization: Maven multi-module build with parent + 3 children (`otel-bootstrap`, `producer-service`, `consumer-service`).
- Initialization: Workshop checkpoints are **annotated git tags on `main`** (immutable, frozen after first delivery), not long-lived branches (WORK-01).
- Initialization: Phase 7 (Polish & Differentiators) is locked into v1 (not deferred post-cohort) per user choice — dashboard, load script, screenshots, full README walkthrough.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 1 research flag**: RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — RESEARCH.md (commit `d3bbf32`) confirms OTel BOM precedes Spring Boot BOM; mise pin is `corretto-17.0.13.11.1` (exact patch, not floating).
- **Phase 3 research flag**: Resolve listener-side extraction mechanism (`MethodInterceptor` advice on `SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory` vs inline extract in `@RabbitListener`) — needs `/gsd-research-phase` before planning.
- **Phase 5 research flag**: Confirm Maven coordinate for MDC injector (`opentelemetry-logback-mdc-1.0` artifact vs `<captureMdcAttributes>` on appender).
- **Phase 6 research flag**: Validate `@ServiceConnection` + `RabbitMQContainer` on Spring Boot 3.4.13.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-29 (Waves 1+2 of Phase 1 executed in parallel worktrees)
Stopped at: Waves 1+2 merged + verified; Wave 3 (1-06 README + exit gate) requires driver-in-the-loop infra/runtime verification.
